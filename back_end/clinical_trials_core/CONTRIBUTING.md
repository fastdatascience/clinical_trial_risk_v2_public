# Contribute to Fast Clinical NLP

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the library. This page will give you a quick overview of how things are organized and most importantly, how to get involved.

## Contribute to the Fast Clinical NLP open source NLP project

Are you a scientist, researcher, data wrangler, or language maestro? Fast Data Science needs YOU! We're always looking for talented individuals to join our team.

* **Contribute to our open-source code:** Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious newbie, your contributions are valued.
* **Join the conversation:** Share your ideas, suggestions, and feedback on our forum and social media channels.


## Getting started

Participating in an open source project can be very rewarding. Read more about it [here](https://harmonydata.ac.uk/how-can-i-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/)!

Please familiarise yourself with Git. You can [fork the library](https://github.com/fastdatascience/clinical_trial_risk_v2_public/tree/main/src/back_end/clinical_trials_core/fork) and [make a pull request](https://github.com/fastdatascience/clinical_trial_risk_v2_public/tree/main/src/back_end/clinical_trials_core/pulls) any time! We're glad to have your contribution.

## Issues and bug reports

First, [do a quick search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Afastdatascience) to see if the issue has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just leave a comment on an existing issue, rather than creating a new one. Old issues also often include helpful tips and solutions to common problems.


## Coding Fast Clinical NLP

Fast Clinical NLP is mostly coded in Python. We use [Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) by JetBrains. Please ensure you are familiar with Python, [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), or Javascript and [React](https://react.dev/) if you want to work on the front end.

Please make sure all code you commit is linted using the [Pycharm default linter](https://www.reddit.com/r/pycharm/comments/mm77el/what_is_the_default_linter_in_pycharm/). If you use a different one (such as VS Code's linter, or pylint), this will make the code history hard to follow, so please be consistent.

## Unit tests and code stability

Fast Clinical NLP uses the [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) framework for testing. For more info on this, see the [pytest documentation](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html). To be interpreted and run, all test files and test functions need to be prefixed with `test_`.

The Fast Clinical NLP Python library [https://github.com/fastdatascience/clinical_trial_risk_v2_public/tree/main/src/back_end/clinical_trials_core](https://github.com/fastdatascience/clinical_trial_risk_v2_public/tree/main/src/back_end/clinical_trials_core) is the core functionality. Most of the logic is in this repo. This repo has unit tests which run automatically on commits to main.
